All PLY objects created using Blender (http://www.blender.org)

Notes on creating a valid PLY for this program:
1. You must triangulate the faces of your object before exporting to PLY,
   otherwise it will not be read into OpenGL correctly.
   You can do this as follows:

   3D View toolbar -> Edit Mode -> Mesh -> Faces -> Triangulate Faces (Ctl T)
